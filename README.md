# Create a streaming log viewer using FastAPI

## Overview

Many times, you need to view the latest log entries generated by your app to check that everything is working or see what is currently broken. We created a FastAPI app that will stream our latest log files entries over websockets. The blog post with more detail is available here:

- [Create a streaming log viewer using FastAPI](https://h3xagn.com/create-a-streaming-log-viewer-using-fastapi/)

## Repo structure and file descriptions

- `main.py`: FastAPI web server using uvicorn. Contains the log viewer page and websocket endpoints.
- `log-generator.py`: Random log entry generator used for testing purposes.
- `templates/index.html`: Log viewer page (client) which established websocket connection to server (`main.py`).

The dependencies and virtual environment details are located in the `Pipfile` which can be used with `pipenv`.
